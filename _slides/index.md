# Introduction #

Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil have evolved, since the
thirteenth century, a finely tuned coordination between, on the one
hand, modular dimensions for street widths and lot sizes, and on the
other, a typology of room shapes and distributions within houses.
Despite being well documented in urban history, this coordination was,
during the past century, often interpreted as contingent and as a
result of the limited material means of pre-industrial societies.
Nevertheless, the continued application and gradual adaptation of
these urban and architectural patterns throughout periods of
industrialization and economic development suggests they respond to
both long-lasting housing requirements and piecemeal urban growth.
This article surveys the persistence of urban and architectural
patterns up to the early twentieth century, showing their resilience in
addressing the requirements of modern housing and urbanisation.

In this article, I examine patterns of urban development
in the traditions of the Portuguese speaking world.
I aim to identify bodies of knowledge, practices, and
regulations prevalent from the thirteenth to the mid twentieth
century that offer examples of decentralised economic and regulatory
controls over urban space, resulting in emergent order systems. These
decentralised processes are not entirely at odds with the design of new
towns, however. The interaction between vernacular development patterns
and planned urban forms is a recurring feature in Portuguese and
Brazilian towns and cities.

Beginning in the mid nineteenth century, these systems contend with fast
and overarching changes in regulations and theories that put their
resilience to the test.
The rapid urban growth in the global South since the twentieth century
has been addressed, predominantly, by means of theories and policies
stressing centralised planning and economies of scale by both
governments and the private sector. In Brazil, the enactment of a 'one
size fits all' federal law on urban policy, nearly twenty years ago, is
acknowledged to have resulted in the spread of boilerplate zoning codes
across medium sized towns, as well as in massive public--private
partnerships that have effectively outsourced urban planning to large
corporations or even to banks. This has come at the expense both of
democratic policy-making and of the agency of peripheral actors, such as
small builders and communities excluded from formal land ownership.

In contrast, traditional Portuguese urbanism is predicated on few
abstract regulations and, most important, a shared body of knowledge
made up of both vernacular and 'classical' principles. Most planning
decisions are, of necessity, entrusted to engineers and builders on the
ground, acting on general guidelines set out by local or central
authorities, especially in the broad expanses of colonial Brazil.
Standard modules for such design decisions as the laying out of street
widths or block and lot sizes are widely understood by builders. In
spite of the high-profile urban renewal and expansion projects of the
late nineteenth century, modelled after Haussmann's Paris or Anglo-Saxon
garden cities, much of the urban fabric in Portugal and Brazil continues
to be laid out in the same piecemeal fashion of Portuguese tradition,
well into the twentieth century if not until the present.

Rather than considering the peripheral survival of traditional urbanism
as an inconsequential holdout at the margins of progress, I propose to
assert its legitimacy as a means to achieve resilient and sustainable
cities within the socio-economic reality of peripheral building
cultures. I do so by documenting its historical patterns, with an
emphasis on vernacular and decentralised knowledge being leveraged by
centralised planning determinations, as well as to the programmes of
working class housing from the mid nineteenth century onwards. This
general aim is achieved by establishing a typological series of
traditional urban fabrics, evidencing the persistence and slow
transformation of urban forms and building patterns.

# Methods and sources #

The outline of this article takes its cues from Miguel de Unamuno's
concept of 'intrahistory', translated into architectural scholarship in
1947 by Fernando Chueca Goitia, and akin to Fernand Braudel's concept of
*longue dur√©e*: not just a description of events taking place over long
periods of time, but a methodological emphasis on the slow unfolding of
social processes over the fast motion of discrete 'facts'. Because
prevailing trends in art and architectural history have since belied
Chueca Goitia's assertion that 'art history .... is purely intrahistory'
[-@chuecagoitia:1981invariantes-castizos, 45], this study is a reminder
that the continuity of traditions is one such long-term unfolding of
historical processes, and thus a legitimate aspect of architectural
history, theory, and practice.

The empirical methods of the British and Italian schools of urban
morphology are promising for the reconstruction of genealogies of
patterns and processes of typological development over long periods of
time, beyond conventional periods defined by change of style in 'high
art'. These methods can 
provide indirect hints to poorly documented features such as
socio-economic arrangements, and in turn establish the continuity and
resilience of urban patterns [@oliveira:2016urban]. The Italian 'school'
of procedural typology provides a significant part of the theoretical
groundwork regarding the possibility of establishing morphological
genealogies of vernacular and traditional urban patterns
[@cataldi:2015tipologie].

The analysis presented in this article thus assumes that making sense of
typological continuity over several centuries is both possible and
legitimate as an endeavour of architectural history. In the
methodological framework of urban morphology and procedural typology
outlined above, prevalent urban and architectural forms can be discerned
by visual analysis of plans. The tabulation of abstract measurements as
a source of statistical analysis not only is unnecessary in this method,
but it also risks obscuring a concrete understanding of the urban space
that stresses the clustering of patterns and the emergence of
morphological districts [@raspiserra:1990concetto].
The persistence of spatial and topological relationships among
elements---general lot shapes, block arrangements and configurations,
and street and square hierarchies---is extracted from visual inquiry on
the documentation [@conzen:2018core]. The goal of this analysis is not
only to derive *local* morphological and syntactic patterns, but also to
point out similarities and typologies prevalent *among* urban
developments across time and space.

Documentation for this research has drawn on mainly graphical
evidence of urban areas in Portugal and Brazil. These graphical sources
have been collected from earlier research, municipal planning offices,
and a few are extant historic drawings from original plans or later
surveys that were preserved in archives. A number of new towns and urban
extensions from the mid to late nineteenth century, laid out by
engineers, surveyors, and builders, provide evidence of the continued
use of traditional modules and of the adaptation of these modules to
local conditions. Because there are few extant drawings from much of the
nineteenth century, discerning these modules involves reconstructing
original land subdivision patterns from present-day conditions. Even
then, many towns in Brazil still lack reliable cadastral maps; this
hampers the ability to conduct statistical analysis and error estimation
from a set of precise measurements. At any rate, the assumption that
there be, somewhere, historical towns preserved in a mythically pristine
condition has led many architectural interpretations astray; even such
iconic heritage sites as Ouro Preto, in Brazil's Minas Gerais state,
underwent significant rebuilding and lot consolidation during the
nineteenth century [@vieira:2016ouro].

# Vernacular roots of Portuguese urban traditions #

This study evidences the significant continuity in urban and building
modules used in Portuguese and Brazilian towns from the thirteenth to
the twentieth centuries. Beginning with the 'birth' of modular urban
design in Portugal in the thirteenth century, a limited set of lot and
street dimensions dominates town planning. A first major inflection in
these standards occurs in the third quarter of the eighteenth century,
with an attempt to shape urban form in response to a systematic
arrangement of the territory. Nevertheless, lot dimensions and house
types undergo little change until the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Then, the adoption of the metric system as well as
the onset of positivist ideals of urban hygiene cause major changes in
lot sizes and plan layouts. Even then, some aspects of traditional house
types are carried on until the 1960s.

Portugal is part of the former Roman imperial province of Lusitania,
later ruled by successive waves of Germanic and North African nobility.
As such, she is representative to some degree of the broader trends in
urban history of the western Mediterranean region. Roman agrarian
colonies [@caniggia:1997analisi] have not made an imprint on the
Portuguese landscape strong enough to condition later development;
therefore, as in most of western Europe, the default Portuguese urban
type is the linear village around a high street [@panerai:2012analyse].

In Fernandes's reconstruction of the ideal type, the village coalesces
around a focal point or landmark, such as a chapel, a market, or the
access to a castle [@fernandes:2014fundacao]. In the high street scheme
(@Fig:casdevideA), the very deep lots around the main thoroughfare
(*rua da frente*) and secondary axes (@Fig:casdevideB) have secondary
frontages that establish a back street (*rua de tr√°s*) on either side,
as described by Teixeira [-@teixeira:2012forma]. A sequence of cross
streets develops to link these parallel roads, forming large urban
blocks (@Fig:casdevideC). These blocks are eventually broken up by
alleys (*travessas*) linking the cross streets (@Fig:casdevideD),
enabling the mature, dense build-up of the town core
[@fernandes:2014fundacao]. Since most Portuguese urban areas originate
in hill towns, the high street often takes the form of a spindle, with a
binary network of main thoroughfares, further adding diversity to the
urban fabric. This system forms hierarchical networks of streets and
urban districts---each one a 'block of blocks', as it were, according to
Orr[^1]---that are able to support diverse uses and social classes
within relatively small areas.

Reconstructed urban plan of Castelo de Vide, Portugal
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Alongside the 'organic' high street village type developing throughout
Portuguese and Brazilian history, three major episodes of centrally
mandated urban planning and design take place, more or less evenly
spaced in time; all of them are spurred by the crown's drive to defend,
populate, and manage Portugal's growing territory:

(1) Mid thirteenth century -- *bastide*-type new towns are conceived to
    secure Portugal's borders with Castille-and-Le√≥n, as well as to
    promote food security for the young realm;
(2) Early sixteenth century -- urban growth and overseas expansion
    promote new standards of parcel planning by both the crown and
    private developers;
(3) Late eighteenth century -- the recognition of Portugal's
    independence and of her colonial possessions requires an efficient,
    and graphically 'rational', policy of new town planning.

The cumulative effect of these three episodes is not only to establish a
Portuguese and Brazilian tradition of planned, yet adaptable, new towns
[@lobo:2012urbanismo], but also that the modular dimensions of these new
town lots become standard measurements in vernacular building practice.
It is likely that this occurs because such measurements were widespread
to begin with, and because of this were adopted in planned towns; the
present state of archaeological knowledge does not, however, allow us to
make assumptions about this possibility.

# Portuguese urban development modules up to the eighteenth century #

In the thirteenth century, Portuguese kings begin a policy of populating
and fortifying their borders through the foundation of new
towns---*vilas novas* or *vilas reais*---, akin to the French and
English *bastides* in southern France and to the *villas reales* in
Castille and Le√≥n. Trindade has shown these Portuguese new towns operate
on similar planning principles as their better known European kin
[@trindade:2009urbanismo]. The Portuguese *vila nova* can be said to be
a fortified high street village with a regular geometric plan and
controlled allotment of land. Caminha on a promontory along the norther
border, one of the earliest and best preserved examples, is organised
around a straight high street, two back streets and two cross streets.
The whole is encircled by a wall. As in many *bastides*, the parish
church is sited away from the central crossing and placed near one of
the gates, where it can be reached easily from the surrounding
countryside. The market square and town hall are located at the opposite
end of the high street (@Fig:caminha). Though there is a geometric
principle behind the plan, its implementation is clearly dictated by
expediency over a punctilious observance of orthogonality, and the edges
of the town are required to bend to the military requirements of the
fortifications adjusted to the terrain.

![Reconstructed foundation town plan of Caminha, thirteenth century, author's drawing after [@trindade:2009urbanismo, 157]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Caminha_plan_13c_reconstructed_01.png){#fig:caminha}

The *vila nova* layout establishes and observes certain geometric
procedures to ensure regularity and the equal distribution of urban
lots. These urban plans are executed in a modular scheme based on whole
number ratios of the traditional Portuguese measurement unit: the span,
or *palmo* (abbreviated to 'p.'), equal to about 22.5 centimetres. 5¬†p.
equal one Portuguese yard or *vara*, thus measuring 1.12 metre. The yard
seems, in fact, to be the least multiple effectively used in most urban
plans. At Caminha, according to the reconstruction proposed by Trindade
(@Fig:caminha-modules), the basic elements of the urban design are
15¬†p.-wide streets (3.4 metres) and lots 25¬†p. (5.6 metres) wide by
60 to 75¬†p. (13.5 to 16.9 metres) deep [@trindade:2009urbanismo,
323-328].

![Reconstructed modular platting of Caminha, thirteenth century, author's drawing after [@trindade:2009urbanismo, 328]. Units: 1 span = 22.5 centimetres and 1 yard = 5 spans = 1.125 metre](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Caminha_plan_13c_ideal.png){#fig:caminha-modules}

Other commonly used lot frontage dimensions are 20¬†p. (4.5 metres) and
30¬†p. (6.75 metres). This range of variations offers lot sizes
convenient for a diversity of use cases, from tiny houses---often with
no more than one or two square rooms---to aristocratic terraces or
flats. As is the case in many Mediterranean building traditions,
Portuguese urban house types are various arrangements of roughly square
cells, up to 30¬†p. in length. The most common plan types for a 20 to
25¬†p. wide lot are either simple dwellings or shops with a longitudinal
*enfilade* of up to three cells, or a differentiated arrangement of two
large rooms at the front and back, with a string of small alcoves in
between, accessed from a side hallway (@Fig:plans).

Author's drawing](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Southern_Portuguese_cell_houses.png){#fig:plans}

Relatively wide and shallow lots 30¬†p. wide by 60¬†p. deep are a
particular standard of rural subdivision in Portugal, known as *ch√£o*
[@carita:1994bairro]. Because of this, they figure prominently in the
suburban expansion of cities, such as in Lisbon's sixteenth century
*extramuros* development known as the *bairro Alto* [@carita:1994bairro,
47-48]. Two 30 √ó 60¬†p. lots can be conveniently subdivided into three
20¬†p. lots for low-income housing or grouped to support a courtyard
block of flats or an aristocratic house (@fig:chao); the latter case is
attested in the bairro Alto during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, whereas the former occurs in nineteenth century suburban
subdivisions in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

# Transitional urban patterns #

The foundation of *vilas reais* sees a resurgence in the third quarter
of the eighteenth century. A protracted animosity with Spain, for
reasons of colonial dominance and dynastic legitimacy, sees king D. Jos√©
I (reigned 1750--1777) and his first minister, the marquis of Pombal,
keen on asserting the political and territorial integrity of Portugal. A
string of new towns founded during this reign near every
Spanish--Portuguese border---in both Europe and South
America---signifies Portugal's ability to effectively control the
territories claimed by her [@delson:1998novas], in addition to
responding to new ideas about the 'rational' organisation of the
territory, already being put in place by Spain [@oliveras:1998nuevas].

Portuguese new towns such as Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio
([@Fig:vilareal]), on the mouth of the Guadiana river in the Iberian
peninsula, exhibit both the persistence of traditional land subdivision
patterns and the changes brought about in the concept of 'rational'
planning. Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio, founded in 1773, is laid out
around a single central square on which both the town hall and the
parish church are located; the market has its own, dedicated building
away from the main square, now devolved exclusively to civic and
symbolic representation. Here, unlike at Caminha, the engineers make it
a point to adhere strictly to the gridiron plan: it helps that the town
is intended as a residential garrison and fishing harbour, while the
actual fortifications are sited on higher ground.

![Plan of Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio. Drawing by Jos√© Sande de Vasconcelos, 1774](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/a8/ca/27a8ca3ae165cbbddf812f116a067e37.jpg){#fig:vilareal}

To facilitate the movement of troops and goods, but also to highlight
the clarity and monumentality of the plan, the streets are much broader
than in the thirteenth century new towns: at 40¬†p. across, they are more
than double the breadth of the Caminha streets and rather oversized for
the single story houses in the original plan. Also, due to the layout
focusing on the central square, a generous 350¬†p. across, the street
hierarchy of older planned towns is lost in Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio.
Despite all these transformations in the eighteenth century attitudes
towards urban design, lot sizes display remarkably little change. The
same 25¬†p. frontages are used in thirteenth century Caminha and in
eighteenth century Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio, with only a slight
reduction in depth, from 60 to 50¬†p. The exact same dimensions for the
central square and lot frontages are used in the 1773 town plan for S√£o
Luiz do Paraitinga, a highway stop on the road to the Brazilian gold
mines [@derntl:2013metodo]. Street sections are, however, somewhat less
consistent, ranging from 40¬†p. at Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio to 60¬†p. at
S√£o Luiz do Paraitinga---a generous breadth first attempted in the
post earthquake rebuilding of Lisbon---and up to 100¬†p. elsewhere in
colonial Brazil [@derntl:2013metodo].

These eighteenth century efforts at rationalising the territory by means
of carefully placed and planned new towns are also remarkable in that
they seem to be the first designs, in Portugal, to mandate specific
building types or the placement of houses. Such matters appear to have
been understood as self-evident or less relevant in earlier periods. The
project for the rebuilding of Lisbon sets the trend here, associating
the regularity of the new city blocks and lots with the uniformity of
mandated fa√ßades [@franca:1989reconstrucao]. Similarly, a number of
surviving drawings for new outposts in the Brazilian frontiers, such as
that of Taquari, in the south ([@Fig:taquari]), establish simple fa√ßade
designs that let one guess the single room layout behind them.

![Plan of the garrison town of S. Jos√© on the Tabiquary river, now town of Taquari, Brazil, by Manoel Vieira Le√£o, c. 1777. Arquivo Hist√≥rico do Ex√©rcito (Rio de Janeiro)](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f7/05/94/f7059414bf7196e4fee5e21f8bd14da8.jpg){#fig:taquari}

Centralised territorial planning in Portugal and Brazil comes to a
sudden halt at the death of D. Jos√© I in 1777, not to resume for almost
a century thereafter. Nevertheless, singular designs for new towns or
extensions during this lull do carry on the principles and modules of
Portuguese tradition. Royal and imperial new towns in Brazil, such as
Niter√≥i (1819) and Petr√≥polis (1843), evidence the continued use of
eighteenth century military engineering principles, with strictly
geometric layouts. As late as the 1850s, two new provincial capitals in
Brazil, Teresina and Aracaju ([@Fig:aracaju]), are planned using the
eighteenth century module of 60¬†p. wide streets forming a gridiron
around a main square facing the river.

![Aracaju, Brazil. Design by Sebasti√£o Bas√≠lio Pirro, 1854. Plan (detail) by Francisco Pereira da Silva, 1857.

# House types and fringe belt development #

The mid nineteenth century urban growth of Rio de Janeiro also shows
evidence of the persistence of traditional modules. A large fringe belt
of public land, the *rossio*, west of the city centre is developed
during the first half of the nineteenth century according to these
modules: its streets are 25, 30, and 100¬†p. in breadth, and blocks are
subdivided, whenever pre-existing conditions allow, into 20¬†p. lots
([@Fig:gotto]).
This area grows into one of the densest and socio-economically diverse
neighborhoods outside the city centre, and also one of the best
preserved nineteenth century districts. This is, in part, due precisely
to the extremely fragmented land ownership pattern of its narrow lots,
which has prevented the consolidation required for large-scale
redevelopment.

Farther to the west, mid nineteenth century development
on green fields introduces notable, though short lived, variations in
the form of 15 and 18¬†p. (3.4 and 4 metre) lots destined for
working-class rental. These extremely narrow lots sometimes unfold to
extreme depths, creating *corti√ßos* (slums or tenements) akin to the
contemporary *ilhas* in Oporto. In Rio, these narrow lots are rapidly
overrun by demand for bulkier apartment or commercial buildings,
however. This short life span of the extremely narrow lots contrasts
with the resilience of the 20 and 25¬†p. lots on the former *rossio*.

![Urban development on the former *rossio* of Rio de Janeiro: 100¬†p. thoroughfare (rua Larga de S√£o Joaquim), 30¬†p. streets (rua de S√£o Pedro and rua do Sab√£o) and 25¬†p. street (cross street), blocks mostly subdivided into 20¬†p. lots.

Haussmanian *perc√©es* by the federal government during
the first half of the twentieth century end up opening several stretches
of this area for the construction of large office buildings, which
compare poorly to the historic fabric in terms of diversity and
pedestrian life.
Nevertheless, those *perc√©es* that take place during the first decade of
the twentieth century demonstrate how resilient the Luso-Brazilian
building traditions are. De Paoli has noted one of the goals of these
early urban renewal interventions is to force the consolidation of
narrow lots into broader ones, at least 6 to 7 metres wide (a
measurement reminiscent of the suburban Portuguese 30¬†p. lot?). However,
several such consolidated lots are redeveloped with two or more
independent structures side by side, rather than one large building
[@paoli:2013outra, 36]. New mixed use buildings granted planning consent
between 1903 and 1908 often preserve the side hallway plan type
([@Fig:saopedro]; compare with [@fig:plans]).

![Approved building application on rua de S√£o Pedro, Rio de Janeiro, c. 1903. Arquivo Geral da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro, reproduced by de Paoli [-@paoli:2013outra]](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Building_on_rua_de_S_Pedro_Rio_de_Janeiro_1903.jpg){#fig:saopedro}

# Effects of metrification on lot frontages #

Meanwhile, in 1834, Portugal officially adopts the metric system,
followed much later by Brazil in 1872. Metrification directly impacts
the construction trades and urban subdivision, not the least because it
is accompanied by a surge in new municipal and national regulations on
building and urban development. An evidence of these changes is recorded
in the urban fabric of the Portuguese city of Oporto, which grows
significantly over the course of the nineteenth century due to
industrial development. The earlier growth spurs, along pre-existing
roads, exhibit traditional urban lot frontages 20 or 25¬†p. wide. On the
rua do Almada, a new thoroughfare opened in 1761 but only developed much
later, on the other hand, lots are standardised at 5 metres wide
([@Fig:almada]).

![Different lot standards before and after metrification in Oporto. Base map by Augusto Carlos Teles Ferreira, 1892](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Lot_modules_in_Oporto.png){#fig:almada}

Metrification and the ensuing drive for ever more comprehensive building
regulations are also at play in early twentieth century S√£o Paulo,
Brazil's own industrial powerhouse. Lemos observes that a positivistic
will to 'improve' low-income housing in that city
[@lemos:1999republica]. Turn of the century regulations deal chiefly
with natural lighting and ventilation requirements in some (not all, at
first) rooms of the house. This results, at first, in conservative (and
inconvenient) designs where the side hallway becomes an open court; only
later do actual side setbacks become common, requiring wider lots
([@Fig:bentofreitas]).

![Rental dwellings in S√£o Paulo, ca. 1900. @lemos:1987ecletismo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Rental_houses_on_Bento_Freitas_Street_S%C3%A3o_Paulo.png/607px-Rental_houses_on_Bento_Freitas_Street_S%C3%A3o_Paulo.png){#fig:bentofreitas}

Even as the example of S√£o Paulo contributes to the dissemination of
side yard houses throughout Brazil in the early twentieth century,
Portuguese builders take a different approach to the mandate of natural
lighting and ventilation. Several public and private developments of the
early twentieth century, especially in the centre and south of Portugal,
experiment with an 8.5 to 9 metre wide suburban housing type made up of
four cells arranged in a square, with or without a hallway. A number of
variations on this type are to be found at Entroncamento, a railway
junction company town from the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries [@paixao:2016bairros]. These dwellings, designed by architects
and engineers, are arranged in pairs, evidencing some familiarity with
current concepts of garden suburbs ([@Fig:entroncamento]). Their
architectural style has often been condemned as merely nostalgic,
representing a superficial attachment to familiar visual cues and,
worse, playing into conservative politics [@rosmaninho:2002casa].
Contrary to this interpretation, which itself betrays a superficial
study of such houses, however, these planned dwellings demonstrate an
understanding of the long typological history of Portuguese houses, and
a conscious effort to adapt it to modern urban principles.

![Two four-cell housing types in Entroncamento, 1925--1928. @paixao:2016bairros](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/3c/5a/323c5aaeb43fab8b2c148867baa99102.png){#fig:entroncamento}

The increasing popularity of garden city principles as well as a
tendency to round up metric dimensions to 10 metre frontages cause the
ultimate break down of this process. In the 1960s, the widespread use of
10-metre frontages encroaches even on historic towns such as Ouro Preto
([@Fig:op-santacasa]). Nevertheless, the damaging effect of this
transformation on the character of traditional urban areas is not
noticed by historic preservationists until much later, in the 1980s
[@motta:1987sphan22, 114]. By then, the exponential urban growth of the
post-war era had already caused major loss of character in such sites.

# Conclusion #

This article surveyed the emergence and transformation of traditional
urban and building patterns in Portugal and Brazil, singling out
recurring measurements and modules.
These town building traditions remain sensibly stable
for nearly five centuries, from the early thirteenth to the mid
eighteenth century. Even as the territorial policies of 'enlightened
despotism' in Portugal impose new, centralised and monumental urban
forms onto the landscape, these forms accommodate most of the existing
practices regarding lot dimensions and house types. A crisis in
traditional patterns arises more sharply with the adoption of the metric
system in Portugal and Brazil during the nineteenth century, followed by
the turn of the century positivist approach to comprehensive urban and
building regulation. Still, elements of traditional building types
persist well into the twentieth century, only to break down in the
second half of that century.

This kind of study relies mostly on planned new towns and large urban
expansions, which show the interaction between top-down designs and
bottom-up vernacular practice. Its most significant drawback is,
therefore, its reliance on a centralised 'act of will' for evidence of
the modularity of decentralised patterns.
Urban infill and redevelopment can provide insights on the
persistence of generic building types, but the constraints of the
existing fabric and land ownership patterns are likely to supplant any
explicit choice of dimensional modules. On the other hand, these same
constraints foster the continued use of plan layouts adapted to the
existing lot sizes. A larger and more detailed body of architectural
documentation might shed light on the relationship between these
constraints and the dimensional limits the traditional building types
can reach.

Customary measurement units play a significant part in the stabilisation
of urban and building types. The *palmo* (span) and especially its
five-fold multiple, the *vara* (yard) provide sensible, minimal modules
for sizing construction elements and laying out urban units---most
importantly, lot and street widths. Lots 20, 25, and 30¬†p. wide occur
consistently up to the mid nineteenth century, both in developments
planned and controlled by the state, and in the private dynamics of
suburban extensions to major cities. These dimensions support specific
building types, consisting of linear arrangements of spatial cells with
or without hallways, that change very little up to the late nineteenth
century.

The successive shocks of metrification and of positivist building
regulations, in the mid to late nineteenth century, provoke conspicuous
changes in urban and building morphology, as well as the eventual split
of the Portuguese-Brazilian tradition into two separate national trends.
Even historic preservation has done little to stem the decline of
traditions, not the least due to the prevailing emphasis, in
preservation theory and practice throughout the twentieth century, on
upholding the fatalist distinction between 'original' and 'addition'
rather than on protecting the continuous *process* giving rise to
traditional urban areas.
Despite this loss, traditional plan layouts continue to provide cultural
references and models for new projects well into the first half of the
twentieth century. The spatial efficiency and functional flexibility of
such types as the townhouse, endowed since the late 1800s with a side
yard, and the foursquare cell house, compare favourably to recent types
of housing and urban development.

The long-term stability of Portuguese building modules is a case that
vindicates, in our age so fond of 'microhistory', the importance
ascribed to intrahistory by Chueca Goitia and Braudel. Yet its value
also reaches beyond the domain of the historian's craft: it is a
statement on the importance of continuity to design practice.
The study of modules in urban and building development shows the
resilience of morphological patterns and professional practices through
time. Standardised street widths, lot sizes, and building types are
valuable evidence of cumulative problem solving; aimless experimentation
and constant starting over from scratch, by contrast, have resulted in
so many failed architectural and urban projects.
