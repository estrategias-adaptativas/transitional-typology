# Introduction #

Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil evolved a finely tuned
coordination between standardized lot sizes and house typology.

This coordination allowed for piecemeal urban growth and the resilient
building of towns and cities up to the early twentieth century.

Here, I want to highlight examples of decentralised processes of
town-building since the thirteenth century that have resulted in
emergent order systems, both in planned new towns and in organic urban
growth.

Traditional Portuguese urbanism relied on just a few general
regulations, and mostly on a shared set of patterns that both formally
trained engineers and vernacular builders had access to.

This system entrusted the professional on site to make most decisions,
and at the same time ensured that these decisions followed from a
unified tradition.

The vernacular town-building patterns in Portugal and Brazil are not
just a result of particular conditions of the Early Modern period.

Because the ability to carry out these patterns rested with the local
builder or engineer, this system provides a model for a decentralized
and resilient urban development.

Vernacular urban modules and building types were even able to adapt to
the early stages of industrialization by generating new housing forms
for working-class and suburban neighbourhoods.

Claims of cultural continuity over several centuries and large regions
are uncommon in historical research nowadays; historians feel safer
treating different periods as if they were incommensurable to one
another.

Against this prejudice I call upon the method of the 'longue durée'
proposed by Fernand Braudel as well as on the concept of 'authentic
invariables' coined by the Spanish architect, Fernando Chueca Goitia.

On a more practical level, I will use the idea of 'typological process',
developed by the Italian architects Saverio Muratori and Gianfranco
Caniggia, to sort out the formal genealogies of Portuguese and Brazilian
vernacular patterns.

Modular urban design takes off in Portugal during the thirteenth
century; from then on, a limited standard of lot and street dimensions
dominates town building.

In the second half of the eighteenth century there is a first and sharp
change in this standard when the Portuguese State tries for the first
time to look at its territory in a global and rationalist way.

Still, there is little change to lot widths and house types for another
century.

The adoption of the metric system in the late 1800s would cause some
change in building modules, but it is really the scale of centralized
planning and housing projects since the twentieth century that break up
the continuity of vernacular urban patterns.

# Vernacular roots of Portuguese urban traditions #

There are several cities in Portugal that originate from Roman colonies
laid out in their classic gridiron plan.

These colonies became Islamic cities during the Middle Ages and some of
them, such as Évora, continued to be inhabited after the Portuguese
conquest.

Still, for the most part, vernacular Portuguese urbanism follows the
Medieval European type of the market village around a high street.

The village begins around a focal point or landmark, such as a chapel, a
market, or the access to a castle; at first, the lots are indefinitely
deep because there is only one street.

Over time, these deep lots around the high road and the ones that are
laid out along branching streets develop secondary frontages that define
a back street on either side.

A sequence of cross streets develops to link these parallel roads,
forming large urban blocks.

These blocks eventually get broken up by alleys linking the cross streets.

This results in a dense build-up of the town core as a 'block of
blocks'---a general principle of traditional towns observed by the New
Urbanist Robert Orr.

Besides the 'organic' high street village type, there are three major
episodes of centrally mandated urban design, more or less evenly spaced
in time; all of them stem from the Portuguese crown's drive to defend,
populate, and manage Portugal's growing territory:

(1) Mid thirteenth century -- *bastide*-type new towns to secure
    Portugal's land borders and to settle agricultural frontiers;
(2) Early sixteenth century -- urban growth and overseas expansion
    promote new standards of parcel planning by both the crown and
    private developers;
(3) Late eighteenth century -- the recognition of Portugal's
    independence and colonial domains requires an efficient,
    and graphically 'rational', policy of new town planning.

In all, these three episodes establish a Portuguese and Brazilian
tradition of planned, yet flexible, new towns.

The modular measurements of these new town lots become standards in
vernacular building practice.

# Portuguese urban development modules up to the eighteenth century #

In the thirteenth century, Portuguese kings begin a policy of populating
and fortifying their borders through the foundation of new towns similar
to the French *bastides* and the Spanish *villas reales*.

The Portuguese *vila nova* is just a fortified high street village with
a regular geometric plan and controlled allotment of land.

Caminha, on a promontory along the norther border, is one of the
earliest and best preserved examples. 

The town is laid out around a straight high street, two back streets and
two cross streets.

But even if there is a geometric principle behind the plan, expediency
on the ground trumps a punctilious observance of geometry, and the
fortification has to follow the terrain.

Here we have certain geometric procedures to achieve an equal
distribution of urban lots.

The modular scheme is based on whole multiples of the Portuguese yard,
about 1 metre and 12 centimetres; this yard divides into 5 spans---hand
spans, literally---of 22 and a half centimetres.

So a standard lot will have a frontage of 5 yards, that is 25 spans, or
just over 5 and a half metres --- enough for a room and a hallway
side-by-side.

These lots are between 60 and 75 spans deep, from 13 and a half to 17
metres, which is not very deep and is a measurement that comes up in
other planned towns even where the plan is not restricted by the
topography.

This means the planners who came up with these measurements might have
taken their cues from a vernacular 'block of blocks' around 60 metres
deep, where two rows of 30-metre deep lots would back onto an alley, and
at some point new frontages would get built on this alley.

Like many Mediterranean building traditions, Portuguese houses are various
arrangements of roughly square cells.

The most basic combinations are just a few cells arranged next to one
another in a compact plan; more elaborate schemes can have large rooms
at the front and back, with a hallway and small alcoves in between.

Starting in the sixteenth century, suburban growth takes a different
form than the simple extension of the high street; rural estates start
being subdivided in a regular platting by private entrepreneurs.

In this case, the module is no longer the narrow 25-span frontage but a
larger lot size, 30 by 60 span or about 6.75 by 13 and a half metres.

Blocks are relatively shallow from the start and they lose the front
street/back street distinction.

This new module supports somewhat larger buildings, even apartment
houses, as in the bairro Alto neighbourhood of Lisbon.

Two 30 × 60 p. lots can be conveniently subdivided into three
20 p. lots for low-income housing or grouped to support a courtyard
block of flats or an aristocratic house.

# Transitional urban patterns #

During the Early Modern period, there is not much population growth in
mainland Portugal.

In the colonial empire, planned new towns usually follow the Renaissance
pattern of shallow blocks, but unplanned Portuguese settlements are
still based on the high street village.

Then, just after 1750, the Portuguese standard for new towns changes
quite sharply.

The philosophy of the Enlightenment puts forward a so-called rational
approach to territorial planning.

At the same time, Portugal needs to reassert the legitimacy of her
borders, and the visible mark of centralized town planning is one way to
achieve this.

First, there is the Lisbon earthquake in 1755; this serves as a blank
slate for the crown to experiment with strictly regular geometries,
taller buildings and broader streets.

At Vila Real de Santo António, right on the border with Spain, this
intention of appearing 'rational' and of claiming territory is evident.

The town has a single main square and, unlike Medieval planned towns,
the engineer refuses to sacrifice geometric regularity for the sake of
adaptation to the terrain---the chosen site is even located far away
from the fortifications, so he could pick a flat area to build on.

To highlight the clarity and monumentality of the plan, the streets are
very broad now: at 40 spans, they are almos three times as wide as in
Caminha.

Despite this, lot sizes do not change much. Here we are back to the
narrow and shallow lots of Caminha, with 25-span frontages and 50-span
depths---that is just over 11 metres deep.

The same broad streets and large main squares show up in many colonial
new towns founded all over Brazil around the same time, although exact
measurements are less consistent overseas than they are in the mainland.

These late eighteenth century plans seem to be the first to mandate
specific building types and even standardized façades.

During the nineteenth century, planned new towns continue to be built
mostly in Brazil, now an independent country.

Aracaju is an example of the survival of the late eighteenth century
principles, with the preference for flat sites, a strict gridiron plan,
a single central square, and narrow and shallow lots.

# House types and fringe belt development #

Traditional urban modules also continue to show up in the planned growth
of existing cities during the nineteenth century.

Here we are looking at Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of Brazil. A
large, flat site to the west of downtown was for a time a preserve of
public land.

When this gets open to development in the early nineteenth century, the
resulting suburb ends up looking even more like a Medieval or
Renaissance new town than like the more recent, late eighteenth century
'Enlightened' plans.

It has a clear hierarchy of street breadths and most lots have 20 span
frontages.

This area grows into one of the densest and socio-economically diverse
neighborhoods outside the city centre, and one of the best preserved
nineteenth century districts to this day.

This is, in part, because the fragmented land ownership pattern of its
narrow lots has prevented the consolidation required for large-scale
redevelopment.

Even urban renewal operations intended to 'modernize' the city couldn't
entirely do away with traditional building types.

In the first decade of the twentieth century there were still some
accepted planning applications that featured traditional rowhouse plans
on 25-span lots.

# Effects of metrification on lot frontages #

In the meantime, there is another 'rationalist' revolution going on in
mid nineteenth century Portugal and Brazil: the switch to the metric
system, together with a push to regulate building standards at a much
more specific level to address modern ideals of natural lighting and
ventilation.

In the long run, going metric means new lot frontages get rounded up, or
more likely down, to arbitrary integer measurements.

This happens in some areas of Oporto during its industrial growth in the
second half of the nineteenth century.

Earlier subdivisions show the traditional 20 and 25 span frontages, but
a newer one rounds this to 5 metres, roughly the mean between the two
traditional frontages.

Brazil is somewhat late to catch up on both the metric system and strict
building regulations, but it eventually happens in Rio de Janeiro and
São Paulo at the turn of the century.

Some working-class houses address these changes not so much by adopting
new lot sizes, but mostly by cutting out some awkward courtyards out of
the hallways in traditional house types.

Eventually, however, building codes would require lot widths to
accommodate both a covered hallway and a side setback.

These strict regulations, together with the fact that most new housing
is getting built as planned subdivisions on cheap land, mean that at
some point the vernacular urban house is no longer the preferred
building type.

Around 1900 in north central Portugal, builders and architects bring a
*rural* house type into this process of urban growth.

This is a vernacular module that has been used in the south of the
country since the Early Modern period; it consists of three or four
rooms arranged in a plan about 40 spans, or 9 metres, square.

This unit is particularly suited to the new mandates on natural lighting
and ventilation that entail wider frontages in new urban buildings.

At the same time, it is not as costly as building a fully detached house
on a very large lot, so during the first three decades of the twentieth
century this 40-span house type becomes a fairly standard solution for
the middle class and even for parts of the working class, such as
railway workers.

In the mid 1920s, the architects of the Portuguese railway explored a
number of variations on the theme of the 9-metre square house in a
planned garden next to the company's main rail yards.

These houses have different configurations of hallways between rooms,
each of them studied with an eye on the modern ideal of efficiency, but
they are all built in load bearing masonry and follow the same sizes and
proportions of their vernacular models.

Recent historians of Portuguese and Brazilian architecture often look at
1920s houses from the superficial perspectives of style and ideology.

They are put off by what they perceive as aesthetic and political
conservatism, and believe these designs are just mindless nostalgia for
pretty houses or, worse, pandering to far right nationalism.

But they are blind to the structural continuity from an Early Modern
rural building type to the suburban working class houses of the 1900s to
1920s.

However, these designs were the last throes of the vernacular town
building patterns.

The anti-urban ideal of modern architecture and a lazy tendency to round
up lot frontages to 10 meters will cause the breakdown of typological
continuity by the second half of the twentieth century.

# Conclusion #

Until then, vernacular patterns in Portugal and Brazil were able to
adapt to changing conditions---planned vs unplanned towns, urban core
infill vs suburban expansion, mainland vs colonial settlements, and so
on.

This continuous typological process lasted for about six hundred years.
Even when engineers and architects tried to encroach on vernacular
architecture in the name of 'rationality' or 'hygiene', they would take
their cues from traditional lot sizes and building types.

The long-term stability of vernacular patterns in the Portuguese
tradition highlights the importance of looking at long-term trends.

The study of modules in urban and building development shows the
resilience of morphological patterns and professional practices through
time.

Standardised street widths, lot sizes, and building types are
valuable evidence of cumulative problem solving.

This evidence contradicts the academic belief that successive historical
periods are incomparable to each other; continuity exists in the real
world, whenever people grasp the value of the knowledge they inherited.
