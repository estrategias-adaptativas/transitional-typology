Traditional towns in Portugal and Brazil have evolved, since the
thirteenth century, a finely tuned coordination between, on the one
hand, modular dimensions for street widths and lot sizes, and on the
other, a typology of room shapes and distributions within houses.
Despite being well documented in urban history [@teixeira:2012forma;
@trindade:2013urbanismo], this coordination was, during the past
century, often interpreted as contingent and as a result of the limited
material means of pre-industrial societies [@leal:2009arquitectos].
Nevertheless, the continued application and gradual adaptation of these
urban and architectural patterns throughout periods of industrialization
and economic development suggests they respond to both long-lasting
housing requirements and piecemeal urban growth. This article surveys
the persistence of urban and architectural patterns up to the early
twentieth century, showing their resilience in addressing the
requirements of modern housing and urbanisation.
